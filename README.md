codespace for JS

# This is a repository to do coding

If I dont have my computer I can code in this codespace
from any computer.

# Preview your HTML file

From wihtin github codespaces you can preview your html file by running a http server
on the remote server.  You can run anything you want on the remote server. 
So we will begin by installing an HTTP Server.

`npm i -g http-server`

once that is installed, then you can just run http-server and it will spin up a server
and a dialog box will appear asking if you want to open in the browser. Click on 
that and you will have your page.
